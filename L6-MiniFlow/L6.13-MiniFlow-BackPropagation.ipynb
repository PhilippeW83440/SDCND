    "How do we determine the effect a parameter has on the cost? This technique is famously known as **backpropagation** or **reverse-mode differentiation**. Those names might sound intimidating, but behind it all, it's just a clever application of the **chain rule**. Before we get into the chain rule let's revisit plain old derivatives."
